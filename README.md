Recipes Project

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The skills I will demonstrate in this project are
    - Properly set up an HTML boilerplate
    - Linking relative paths within the working directory to links of other pages (other recipies)
    - Used proper HTML element tags to accuretly code desired site look/funciton
